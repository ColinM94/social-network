# social-network
Social network web application written in PHP for Data Driven Applications module in 2nd Year. Completed in 2015.

My website is a social networking site similar to Facebook. It will allow users to create an account. They will then log in and will be brought to their profile page. There they can post status updates and edit their profile. They can change their profile picture, relationship status and write a description of themselves. They can search for people, view their profile and add them.

The main page of the website allows the user to create an account or log in to their existing account. This page will have php and pdo code to process the forms.

A logged in user will be presented with their profile page. This page will display the users profile picture along with their description and allow the user to post status updates. The rest of the page will have dynamically generated content made up of the users status updates and other user activity.
